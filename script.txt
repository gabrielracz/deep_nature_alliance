YEAR 3620 Potentia Era [1] Kinva Domin S-65:

Does a dream justify its costs?

I am a Colonel of the DNA J8-027th Division Fifth Reich.
After a regular reconnaissance and suppression mission I have been promoted to Colonel.
This comes off of the back of many of my subordinates committing to a full augment after they
gave their organic conscious to suppress many FOD stricken citizens across the J Dominion. 
After our reconnaissance this resulted in the obliteration of CIV SECTORS: J-98, J-67, J-04 and the crippling of much of the rest of the sector.
I earn my rank to little personal sacrifice.

Today, marks what has been declared as the great "Potentia" Era.
After the successful testing of the MK in the unpopulated S9-6T sector, which has been described to the rest of the middle supercluster as essential resource generating technology.
Us in the Inner DNA ranks know its better use as a PMDW (Powerful Mass Destruction Weapon).
This test was done to a sector adjacent to a close friend.

One I made a promise to.

I break rank to investigate;
the specter of bloodshed looms over me.

I make the jump to sector S9-7T...

You pick up the pill
There is a message attached...

[ITEM COLLECT ATTACHED MESSAGE]

Enclosed is a HO4QX2 Compound Pill the only one ever produced from our testing.

The resistance will likely fail to create a protective barrier to save this sector from the MK blast.

We have 1 day.
Some are banking on trying to avoid the blast in the hostile edge of this sector...
Many have already chosen to incinerate themselves trying to jump out.

Our testing has produced that dusting an object with a HO4QX2-Like compound will protect it from
MK assimilation but human testing has resulted in horrifying results.

The HO4QX2 will assimilate all atoms in its close vicinity including human DNA
creating something (from our testing) completely random, turning rock matter into living for example,
or worse a melding of the victim and its surroundings.

Ever since joining the resistance I have developed what has been called Fear Of Death. 
Which is a capital punishment once diagnosed. 

I was told by comrade that historically it used to not be like this.
Many many years ago much of what was expected of us to achieve day to day was completely unfeasible and "unnatural"; including Fear Of Death. 
It was seen as a natural thing, a common part of the human experience.
I have watched as great successful leaps into beneficial and powerful technology have happened frequently and rapidly.
Many things which have improved the lives of billions ultimately to put more unnatural expectations on each and every one of them.
It is funny how I reach this revelation when tomorrow a bomb will strike and take everything natural about me 
and scramble it with every man made building and circutboard around me.

Many years ago a childhood friend made a promise to me.
One day we would reach the outer stars and form a life together...
Only high ranking DNA officials can ever hope to reach those stars.
Its to a DNA weapon I meet my demise...

Does a dream justify its costs?

[ANSWERS NO]

You take the pill.

I hope to become a mountain.
Covered in trees, rocks and soil.
May only the wind reach my peak.
May animals feed and play in my hands.
May I be unmovable to any force of will.

Roll credits.

[ANSWERS YES]

You pocket the pill.

You are the bright shining star the people of the new generation desperately need.

Unfortunately, your ships JMP Drive is indeed broken and it will be a few hours until the rescue crew arrives.

How about you enjoy the scenery Colonel. Heh.

You earned it soldier.
